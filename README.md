# cisco-python-essentials-1
This repository contains my progress for the Cisco python essentials course on their website. </br>
</br>
LearningLog[0] - In this learning log series, i will be completing the Python Essentials course by Cisco networking academy. I'll to do this in one sitting. Trying to get it done by the end of that particular day. 
The main goal of this entire series is to be able to or be knowledgable enough about Python to that extent that i am able to appear for the PCEP test.</br>
LearningLog[1] - <br/>
--- How does a computer program work?
---> First and foremost, what is a program, A program is something that makes a computer work, it helps the program achieve something by writing a certain set of instructions in a programming language like Java, C, C#, Python etc. Computer programmers are typically written by programmers who use speclialized software tools to write and debug code. Once the program is complete it is converted to something called as the machine language. A machine language consists of only 1s and 0s. There are two types of languages, Low level languages and High level languages. Low level languages like Assembly. Low level languages directly deal with the inner working of the CPU, whereas programming languages like Java, C, C# they are called as High level languages because they do not deal directly with the inner working of the CPU. A program is a set of instructions to perform a specific task.</br>

--- Difference between a natural language and a programming language? </br>
---> A language is something that is used to for communication, for example English is a natural language, it is used as a means of communiciation with someone who understands that language too. Similarly computers also have their own language called the Machine Langauge, this language is used by the computers to interact amongst themselves. Machine language consists of 0s and 1s. Langauges like English, Hindi, Spanish, these languages are constantly evolving with new words, language like these are called as Natural Language. A complete set of commands or instructions is known as or called as an Instruction List.</br>
</br>
--- Machine language vs High Level Languages
---> A Machine language is the language used by the computers to communicate between them, it is the mother tongue of computers. Humans/Programmers need a language that enables them to communicate with the computer that is far more complex than something like a machine language, and something is yet far simpler than something like a Natual Language. These languages are called as High Level Languages.</br>
</br>
--- Difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
---> Compilation is the process of translating the source code into machine code as a whole. The process compilation every time generates machine code. Whereas Interpretation is also the process of translating the source code into machine code, which is never done during interpretation. Compiler is the program that takes care of the process of compilation, it is called as a translator. Interpretor is the program that successfully runs the interpretation of the program. </br>
